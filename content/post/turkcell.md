As we know, BRK made an investment in Verizon (VZ), the American telecom provider. But is it's Turkish counterpart Turkcell (TKC) a better investment for us?

Turkey based Turkcell is in many ways a similar business to the American based Verizon. For sure the political circumstances in Turkey increases risk, but is this risk in proportion to the current discount on Turkcell's stock price? No, in this article I would like to show that the market is currently over pessimistic about the political circumstances and mis-pricing Turkcell considerably.

### Turkcell vs. Verizon: company and market

Generally speaking, the telecom markets in America and Turkey are very similar as opposed to the EU telecom market. In America and Turkey you see three big players how serve most of the market and they have pricing power (US: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Turkey: Turkcell, Vodafone, Turk Telekom). To be straight to the point, Americans and Turkish pay a lot for their phone calls compared to people in the EU. This is because of the EU's antitrust policy, which is very strong and is working very effectively. You can observe this in the amount of telecom providers in the EU and the pricing of their products over time (which decline). As a side effect, the pricing power is handy in an inflationary environment. Something which is happening in Turkey for several years and we see that Turkcell is able to increase their prices accordingly.

Looking at the differences between Verizon and Turkcell in terms of company and market?

### Risks: political circumstances and currency

Turkcell being listed in NY follows IFRS accounting standards. Having said that there are two trends which impose risk and is a potential reason why the stock price of the shares listed in NY are depressed. Let's first talk about the political situation and secondly about the depreciation of the Turkish Lira (TRY).

It is not a secret that the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has put the country on a conservative course and has taken distance from the EU. Erdogan founded the AKP party in 2001 and he is serving as president since 2014. He has reinforced his grip on the country since then. For example by increasing censorship on social media and corruption. In the last 10 years I have been to Turkey multiple times and I experienced the country's conservative transition myself. Were the restaurants in Istanbul sold alcohol during my first few visits. Many stop doing that since then. Also, being an engineer myself, I got many Turkish colleagues in the last few years. Yong talented engineers how move out off Turkey to find a good job elsewhere. This brain drain is obviously not good for Turkish economy.

Inflation in Turkey is in high single digits and the depreciation of the TRY compared to the USD accelerated in last few years:
USD/TRY 2016: 3.0
USD/TRY 2017: 3.6
USD/TRY 2018: 4.8
USD/TRY 2019: 5.7
USD/TRY 2020: 7.0
USD/TRY now: 8.6

Looking at these risks, I think, being a value investor, it is not my/our job to predict if these trends will reverse or not. Therefore, I will take these risks into account as is and assuming they will continue to be there in the future.

How to interpret the currency risk? Turkcell is trading in Istanbul and in New York. Buying the shares in NY in USD and with the business operated in TRY clearly exposes you to currency risk. Turkcell's pricing power protects you.

### Investment thesis

Looking at Turkcell's activities and market environment, we see similarities with those of Verizon. We also see that Turkcell is expanding their business to go from a telecom provider to a provider of digital services. Although, for now, the revenue and profit come from the telecom business, their expansion into cloud services might be promising in the future.
