It looks like every engineering software package can do Topology optimization these days. Here is my experience...

## General notes...

..* Every self respecting engineer software package has a Topology optimization module these days, but don't be supprized if they all give you different results for the same problem. Why? Because the software tools are just being developed and there are a lot of parameters to tune which influenced the result. So basically, there is no standard jet.
