As we know, BRK made an investment in Verizon (VZ) the American telecom provider. Is it's Turkish counterpart Turkcell (TKC) a better investment for us?

Turkey based Turkcell is in many ways a similar to American based Verizon. For sure the political sercomstances in Turkey increases risk, but is this risk in proportion to the current discount on Turkcell's stock price? No, in this article I would like to show that the market is currently over persimistic about the political circomstances and mispricing Turkcell considerably.
