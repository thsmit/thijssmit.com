# What I am doing now...

([This is a /now page](https://nownownow.com/about/))

## Two years into my PhD

## Going 'deep' into Value investing

With 'deep' refering to a term used in the book Deep work by Carl Newport.

## Life in Switzerland

For my PhD at the ETH Zurich I moved to Switzerland in the summer of 2019. Being a fanatic sailor I couldn't wait to sail the beautiful lakes here. Unfortunately, I have to conclude that by Dutch standards, there is only very seldom enough wind for serious sailing. Therefore, I moved to road cycling...

## Road cycling: [alpenbrevet](https://www.alpenbrevet.ch/en/)

As being born and raised in The Netherlands, cycling is not strange to me. Now that sailing is not really an option, I am doing a lot of road cycling and set myself a nice target: the [alpenbrevet](https://www.alpenbrevet.ch/en/). This is an amateur tour through the Swiss alps starting and finishing in Andermatt, Uri.
