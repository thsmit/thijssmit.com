abstract: "Origami has become a source of inspiration in engineering for structural design and the creation of mechanical metamaterials. In the often used analytic geometric and energy methods, it is difficult to incorporate deformation of the faces in non-rigid origami. However, deformation of the faces can play a significant role in their mechanical behaviour. This thesis aims to investigate and improve the design of non-rigid origami structures by using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which is well suited to model all deformations of these structures."

summary: "In collaboration with the Bertoldi Group at Harvard University, FEM is applied on the new bistable non-rigid origami structure called the Star bellow. The suitable building blocks of the FEM approach, arefinite rotation shell elements to model the faces of the structure, torsional spring elements to model the crease lines, and a Newton-Raphson arc-length control solution procedure."
