Hi, I am Thijs. I'm a PhD student in Biomechanics, born and raised in Rotterdam, living in Switzerland. In my PhD, I am developing computational design and optimization tools for orthopedic implants, which you can check out at on my Github page: [<em class="fab fa-github fa-fw"> </em>](https://github.com/thsmit).

My free time I spend on the bicycle in the Alps and I am a value investing enthusiast.
